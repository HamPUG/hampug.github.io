reStructuredText Editors
========================

ReStructuredText editors will normally provide two panes. In the left hand pane you enter text in a reStructuredText form. The right hand pane provides a live preview of what the document will look like when converted to HTML, stored on a web-server and then displayed by your web-browser.

On-Line Editor
--------------

On line editors may be used. For example at http://rst.ninjs.org/

Linux Application Editor
------------------------

Alternatively you may download a reST editor and install it on your computer. For example the application **Retext**. When using a linux computer with Ubuntu or Debian then Retext may be installed with the command::

    sudo apt-get install retext

When you launch Retext it will only show the left-hand pane for entering your text. Click on the drop-down arrow to the right of the *Preview* button on the menu bar and check *Live Preview*. The right-hand pane will open up and display what your reST will look like when converted to be displayed on a web-browser.

More information is available on Retext at their `github repository`__.

Note that Nikola provides additional functionality to reST that is not present using these editors. For example, displaying mathematical equations. To observe if these equations are correctly converted by Nikola to HTML, you will need to run the server supplied with Nikola and use your web-browser.
