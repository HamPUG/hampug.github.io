Website Creation
================

Introduction to reStructuredText, Nikola and PythonAnywhere
-----------------------------------------------------------

This web-site http://hampug1.pythonanywhere.com has been created by the `Hamilton Python Users Group`_ *HamPUG* to aid in learning how to create `reStructuredText`_ markup language web-pages for use by the `Nikola`_ static web-site generator and then using `PythonAnywhere`_ to host the web-site.

.. _reStructuredText: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText
.. _Nikola: https://getnikola.com/
.. _PythonAnywhere: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PythonAnywhere
.. _Hamilton Python Users Group: http://hampug.github.io/


While each of these three components has its own web-site with documentation, this web-site attempts to place together the basic information that is required to create, build, and deploy this type of static web-site.

The following pages are provided on this web-site:

- Steps
    - `Steps`_: A list of steps to create, build and deploy a Web-site
   
- reStructuredText
    - `reST Editor`_: Online or local application reST editor
    - `reST Basics`_: Getting started with creating a web-page.
    - `reST Directives`_: Commands available in reST

- Nikola
    - `Nikola Basics`_: Introduction to Nikola

- PythonAnywhere
    - `PythonAnywhere Introduction`_: Static Website creation at PythonAnywhere
