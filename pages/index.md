<b>Status of the Hamilton Python Users Group</b></h2>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
The Hamilton Python Users Group operated monthly meetings for 10 years from February 2014 to September 2023. We no longer have monthly meetings.<br>
This <i>Nikola</i> generated website has been kept as an historical record of HamPUG. We haved a repository on Github for our Python code and presentation slides, etc. Use <i>Repository</i> and <i>Meetings</i> tabs for links to this information.

The **Ham**ilton **P**ython **U**sers **G**roup (HamPUG) is for anyone who is enthusiastic in
writing and learning the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

Our monthly meetings are in Hamilton, New Zealand.

We get together at 7pm on the second Monday of each month (except January). The Waikato University
School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences currently sponsor our gatherings and 
provide a meeting room on the campus. This is room **MS4.G.02**. Please see the [map](/map/).

There is no charge for admission to the HamPUG meetings. 

The normal format is for there to be presentations on a particular topic or theme. 
The room is equiped with a video projector for displaying slide shows or python code 
from a laptop. After this we normally have a cup of tea and a chat.

You are welcome to bring along your laptop or files on a USB stick, and show
any code you've been writing. Those attending will be happy to provide
assistance on any programming difficulties that you may be having trouble
resolving.

We look forward to seeing you at our next meeting.

### Update: Added second website

A website, which is a tutorial on *Website Creation* using *Nikola*, *reST* and *Pythonanywhere* has been appended to this website. 2025-03-06.
