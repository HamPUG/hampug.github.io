The Hamilton Python Users Group operated monthly meetings for 10 years from February 2014 to September 2023. We no longer have monthly meetings.<br>
This <i>Nikola</i> generated website has been kept as an historical record of HamPUG. We haved a repository on Github for our Python code and presentation slides, etc. Use <i>Repository</i> and <i>Meetings</i> tabs for links to this information.

Some Hamilton based Python enthusiasts used to regularly travel to Auckland to attend the
meetings of the Auckland Python Users Group. They put forward the idea of having
a local Hamilton Python Users Group. The University of Waikato School of Computing & 
Mathematical Sciences provide the sponsorship of hosting a room for the Hamilton meetings.

Hamilton Python Users Group had their first gathering at 7pm on 25th February 2014.
The meeting was held at Waikato University in room MS4.G.02. 

Since then meetings have been held on the second Monday of each month. The meetings have normally 
been held in room MS4.G.02, with a few exceptions when the room was booked for
student examinations, and we had a gathering in The Cook bar and restaurant.

Many of the meetings included the delivery of slide shows and demonstrations of
python code. Most of these presentations and demonstration code have been
preserved in our [meetings](https://github.com/HamPUG/meetings) section of the
[HamPUG](https://github.com/hampug) github repository.

### Website

This website was initially created by Ian Stewart as a way of gaining experience with
Web2Py framework that is provided on the pythonanywhere.com website.

In March 2023 it was re-written using the [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) static website generator.
The output from Nikola was uploaded to hampug.pythonanywhere.com 

In March 2025, the two Nikola websites that were located at hampug.pythonanywhere were combined and moved to [hampug.github.io](https://hampug.github.io). The source code of this website may be viewed at [github.com/hampug.github.io](https://github.com/hampug.github.io).
