HamPUG meetings are held at Waikato University building **MS4.G.02** at 7pm on the
second Monday of the month (except January). In the event that the Monday is a 
public holiday then the meeting is held the next normal business day.

The map below shows Hillcrest Road running through the middle from north to south. 

When travelling by car, exit Hillcrest Road at Gate 7 and drive around the 
Law Building and Management School to get to parking next to MS4.G.02. In the
evenings it is OK to park in the *reserved* parking lots.
